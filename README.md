# Induction-program-CSE ;.My name is Dhiraj Kumar.My father name is jagdev ray.My branch name is CSE .My strength is physics.My aim is ISRO joining (space studying ).After the break, we gathered in the main auditorium for an orientation session that gave us a deeper understanding of life at GNDEC. The faculty walked us through the institute’s **history and vision**, helping us see the legacy we’re now a part of. They also introduced us to the wide range of **facilities, resources**, and **student-led clubs and labs** available on campus, which opened our eyes to the many ways we can grow both personally and professionally during our time here.

What made the session even more meaningful was the presence of the **chief guest**, who shared inspiring words drawn from real-life experience, reminding us of the potential each of us holds. Our **seniors** also played a key role, warmly welcoming us and offering support that made us feel comfortable and at ease in this new chapter of our lives.

Most importantly, our **professors** offered guidance that went beyond academics. They encouraged us to stay curious, work hard, and use every opportunity to shape ourselves into capable and confident individuals. Their words gave us clarity and direction, and left many of us feeling motivated and hopeful about what lies ahead.[8/1, 6:00 PM] 0: Once we returned to campus, we took a well-deserved break and recharged with some delicious refreshments. The courtyard was lively as everyone enjoyed crispy **pakoras**, steaming **hot chai**, mouth-watering **gulab jamuns**, and chilled drinks. It was the perfect combination to lift our spirits and energize us for the exciting activities that were about to follow. The food, the setting, and the company made it a truly refreshing pause in the day.
[8/1, 6:00 PM] 0: We began our day on a peaceful and spiritual note, as our entire batch walked together to the campus Gurudwara Sahib. The atmosphere was serene, and the soulful **shabad kirtan** playing in the background created a deep sense of calm. It felt like the perfect way to center ourselves before diving into the busy schedule ahead — a quiet moment of reflection and togetherness before the hustle truly began.

Even though we don’t want to, a fight does take place once again
